          The new design skills that my work on this project introduced are learning how to create and manipulate 3D objects utilizing OpenGL.
     The design process started as trying to choose a scene that would be recreated in a 3D environment. By visualizing what objects could be 
     recreated as 3D from the scene, the design process started by creating one object and then incorporating the others in the scene similar 
     to how the objects are represented in 2D. A tactic from this design approach that can be applied to future work is the one that suggests 
     that it is best to break a large project into smaller chunks and more modular chunks, with reusability of the code used as much as possible.
     
          The development strategy most used in recreating this scene involved creating a single object and then trying to find a way to create
      the others without using a single file of code.  After much research, I was able to create a coordinates file that would hold all the 
      vectors for the objects which organized them as functions in a coordinate’s header file.  A separate mesh was created for each object 
       in the main file which called the respective coordinates to retrieve the vectors.  This allowed the program to iterate through the 
       vectors of each object on its own rather than having all the vectors contained in a single mesh. By modularizing the code this way,
       it allowed me to edit the individual objects when adding the additional requirements, such as texture and the light source more easily.
          
          The computational graphics and visualization work was extremely new to me and I learned that there is a lot more to computer science
     that I could branch out into if I wanted.  Although it is not my aspiration to design 3D graphics, I learned that it really is a lot of work 
     and a true artform that requires a lot of patience and talent to achieve really good results. I also learned that the object-oriented principals 
     that are applied to many other coding projects are also required in order to create the 3D graphics and that the ideals of abstraction and 
     modularization also are very important to apply. 
     
          For the future professional pathway, this course taught me to reach very far out of my comfort zone and to attempt something that is very
     new and challenging, even though it required a lot of work and additional research. It reminds me of the age old adage “You can do whatever 
     you want if you put your mind to it”. I believe that this is a very important mind set to have and will remember to carry this forward into
     my professional career.
